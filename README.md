# there's no escape from the inevitability of death so make the most of life

that's a fun quote i just made. it's actually quite easy, you just need some sort of juxtaposition and then connect them somehow. boom deep quote

but anyways welcome to my about me, this is what people see whenever they click on my god-forsaken profile, so i'd better make the most of it. here are my most important principles

## 1. NFTs are the worst.

I hate them.

## 2. Programming is kinda overrated.

It's very easy to do, unless you're trying out Brainf*** for the first time.

## 3. Don't even try to comprehend Brainf***.

Just don't. Spend your time on something more productive.

## 4. Broccoli is pretty good.

Try them steamed!

## 5. Brussel sprouts are just as bad as they seem, almost as bad as NFTs (worse than baked beans!)

Don't try them at all!

## 6. MagicBot is the superior framework in Python.

In the FIRST Robotics Competition, MagicBot is the best framework for programming a robot in Python. It just is. Get your dirty C++/Java command-based framework out of my face.

## 7. Lefty loosey righty tighty.

Never forget this.

## 8. If you forget that, just remember "alliteration then rhyme" to figure out what the words are.

You really shouldn't forget that.

## 9. If you forget *that*, you're screwed.

You just are.

## 10. Thou shalt not covet.

Woops, wrong 10 principles.
